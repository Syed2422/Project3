### Analysis of Metrics
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Indicates the average squared difference between predicted and actual values. A lower MSE means more accurate predictions. The Random Forest model has a lower MSE, indicating better accuracy.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average of the absolute errors between predicted and actual values. A lower MAE indicates closer predictions to actual stock price growth. Random Forest again outperformed XGBoost in this metric.
- **R-squared (R²)**: Represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (stock growth) that can be explained by the independent variables. A higher R² value indicates better model fit. Random Forest had a higher R², suggesting it captured more of the market's underlying dynamics.

- **1. Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Explanation: MSE is a measure of the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values. It penalizes larger errors more than smaller ones because the errors are squared.
Importance in Stock Market: In the stock market prediction, a lower MSE indicates that the model is making more accurate predictions with smaller discrepancies between actual and predicted values. Since stock prices are volatile, minimizing this error helps the model provide predictions that are closer to actual market movements.
Interpretation: The Random Forest model has a lower MSE (0.3360), which suggests that it is more accurate in predicting stock growth compared to XGBoost, whose MSE is 0.4791. This means the Random Forest model produces smaller errors in its predictions, making it a better fit for stock price forecasting.

- **2. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Explanation: MAE measures the average of the absolute errors between predicted and actual values. It provides a direct measure of how far off predictions are, in the same units as the target variable (stock growth percentage in our case).
Importance in Stock Market: MAE is a good indicator of the model's average error in the stock market context. A lower MAE means the model is on average closer to predicting the actual market movement, which is crucial for making accurate investment decisions.
Interpretation: The Random Forest model has a lower MAE (0.1148), meaning its predictions are closer to the actual stock growth compared to XGBoost (0.1944). A smaller MAE indicates that Random Forest provides more reliable and precise predictions.

-**3. R-squared (R²)
Explanation: R² represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (stock growth) that is predictable from the independent variables. It measures the goodness of fit for the model.
Importance in Stock Market: R² tells us how well the model can explain market behavior based on the features (earnings, sentiment, etc.). In the stock market, a higher R² means the model can better capture the underlying factors that drive stock price movements.
Interpretation: The Random Forest model has a higher R² (0.9793), meaning it explains a larger proportion of the variance in stock price growth compared to XGBoost (0.9705). A higher R² indicates that Random Forest captures more of the market dynamics, leading to better predictions.
